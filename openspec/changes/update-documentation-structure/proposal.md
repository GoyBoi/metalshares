## Why
The MetalShares project needs proper OpenSpec documentation structure to track website build progress and architecture. Currently, the OpenSpec setup is minimal with only basic instructions. We need to implement comprehensive specifications for both the website structure and build progress tracking to improve project management and development consistency.

## What Changes
- Create comprehensive website structure specification documenting components and architecture
- Create build progress tracking specification for documenting features, bugs, and verification
- Update project.md with proper project context for the MetalShares platform
- Establish proper OpenSpec conventions for ongoing development

## Impact
- Affected specs: website-structure, build-progress
- Improved project documentation and tracking capabilities
- Better visibility into development progress and project status
