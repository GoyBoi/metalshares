## Why
The MetalShares website needs improved theme consistency to ensure all elements properly support light/dark mode with optimal readability and visual appeal. While the current implementation has basic theme support, there are opportunities for enhancement to ensure proper contrast ratios, consistent styling across all elements, and improved user experience.

## What Changes
- Enhance theme consistency across all UI components
- Improve contrast ratios for better readability in both themes
- Add missing dark mode variants for any elements that lack them
- Create comprehensive theme testing methodology

## Impact
- Affected specs: website-structure
- Improved user experience with consistent light/dark mode support
- Better accessibility with proper contrast ratios
- Enhanced visual appeal in both themes
