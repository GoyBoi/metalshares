# MetalShares Styling Fixes Summary

## Overview
Successfully resolved all styling issues on the MetalShares website by implementing proper shadcn components and correcting CSS definitions.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Incorrect Glassmorphism CSS Definition
**Problem**: The `.glass` class in `globals.css` was using generic white background instead of the project's color palette.
**Fix**: Updated the class to use `bg-spring-wood/70` and `border-everglade/20` to match the MetalShares color scheme.

### 2. Manual Styling Overriding shadcn Components
**Problem**: Several components were applying manual styling classes that overrode the shadcn component styling, breaking consistency.
**Fixes Applied**:
- **Hero.tsx**: Removed manual styling from Button components to use shadcn defaults
- **Navbar.tsx**: Added proper Button import and replaced manual buttons with shadcn Button components
- **Index.tsx**: Removed manual glass styling from Card components to rely on the global CSS class
- **TestimonialCard.tsx**: Fixed import path and removed manual styling that overrode shadcn Card component

### 3. Inconsistent Component Usage
**Problem**: Components weren't consistently using shadcn styling, leading to visual inconsistency across the site.
**Fix**: Updated all components to properly utilize shadcn's built-in styling system while maintaining the MetalShares color palette.
