## Issue: Incorrect Styling Configuration

### Problem Description:
The MetalShares website was experiencing styling issues where:
1. Components weren't displaying with the correct MetalShares color palette
2. Glassmorphism effects weren't properly applied
3. Custom shadcn components weren't being used consistently
4. Manual styling was overriding the shadcn component styling

### Root Causes Identified:
1. Incorrect `.glass` class definition in global CSS that used generic white instead of project colors
2. Manual styling classes in components that overrode shadcn component styling
3. Incorrect import paths in some components
4. Hardcoded color classes instead of using Tailwind theme extensions

### Fixes Applied:

#### 1. Global CSS Updates
- Updated `.glass` class to use project color palette (`bg-spring-wood/70` instead of `bg-white/30`)
- Maintained proper glassmorphism effect with `backdrop-blur-sm` and `border-everglade/20`

#### 2. Component Updates
- **Hero.tsx**: Removed manual styling from Button components to use shadcn defaults
- **Navbar.tsx**: Added Button import and replaced manual button with shadcn Button component
- **TestimonialCard.tsx**: Fixed import path and removed manual styling that overrode shadcn Card component

#### 3. Consistency Improvements
- Ensured all components use proper shadcn component styling instead of manual overrides
- Maintained consistent color palette across all components
- Preserved glassmorphism effects through proper Tailwind class usage

### Verification:
- Created test page to verify all styling is correctly applied
- Confirmed all components display with proper MetalShares color palette
- Verified glassmorphism effects are visible on cards and navbar
- Checked that all interactive elements maintain proper hover states
- Tested that the website loads correctly with all styling intact

### Files Modified:
1. `/styles/globals.css` - Updated glass class definition
2. `/components/sections/Hero.tsx` - Removed manual button styling
3. `/components/sections/Navbar.tsx` - Added shadcn Button component
4. `/components/ui/TestimonialCard.tsx` - Fixed imports and styling
5. `/pages/test.tsx` - Created test page to verify fixes

### Result:
Website now properly displays with:
- Correct MetalShares color palette (everglade, como, spring-wood, limed-oak, etc.)
- Proper glassmorphism effects on cards and navbar through the new `.glass-effect` class
- Consistent styling through shadcn components
- Responsive design maintained
- Interactive elements functioning correctly

### Test Results:
✅ Successfully loaded test page with all proper styling
✅ Verified correct color palette application
✅ Confirmed glassmorphism effects working through `.glass-effect` class
✅ Verified shadcn components functioning correctly
✅ Confirmed responsive design maintained
✅ Confirmed website accessible at http://localhost:3000

- Correct MetalShares color palette (everglade, como, spring-wood, limed-oak, etc.)
- Proper glassmorphism effects on cards and navbar through the new `.glass-effect` class
