# MetalShares OpenSpec Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a summary of the OpenSpec implementation for the MetalShares luxury metals investment platform. OpenSpec provides a specification-driven development approach that helps maintain clear requirements, scenarios, and development progress tracking.

## Project Context
MetalShares is a luxury metals investment platform website that provides an elegant, sophisticated user experience for investors interested in precious metals. The platform features a modern design with glassmorphism effects, luxury color palettes, and responsive functionality.

## Implementation Status

### Completed Documentation
- [x] Project context and conventions defined
- [x] Website structure specification created
- [x] Build progress tracking specification created
- [x] Change proposal for documentation updates
- [x] Task tracking for implementation steps
- [x] Delta specifications for tracking changes

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
1. When implementing new features, refer to the relevant specifications in `specs/`
2. When proposing changes, create a new change proposal in `changes/[change-id]/`
3. Update documentation as development progresses to maintain accuracy
4. Use the verification checklist before deploying changes

### For Project Management
1. Review the build progress spec to understand tracking methodologies
2. Monitor project status through documented artifacts
3. Ensure all development aligns with specified requirements
4. Use OpenSpec to maintain visibility into development status

## Standards and Conventions

### Technology Stack
- Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- Shadcn UI components
- Radix UI primitives
- React Hook Form and Zod for validation

### Design Principles
- Component-based architecture
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Luxury aesthetic with glassmorphism effects
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Performance optimization

### Documentation Format
- Requirements use SHALL/MUST for normative statements
- Scenarios follow the WHEN/THEN pattern
- All requirements include at least one scenario
- Consistent terminology across all documents

## Next Steps

1. Continue using OpenSpec for all future feature development
2. Update specifications as new requirements emerge
3. Maintain comprehensive documentation as the project evolves
4. Use OpenSpec tools to validate specifications and changes
5. Regularly review and archive completed changes
